# TODO

- Need to come up with a new curve.jump method for drawline and set curve up combination
- Need to define standard color names for both latex text and color in MP.
  Switch over to using \mpcolor macro so that we can use standard xcolor names
- Need to implement a custom function to break the columns of a table
  so that the vertical bar character is only treated as a column separator
  when it is proceeded and followed by a space at the same time, or as the last
  character of the line, or as the first character of the line.
