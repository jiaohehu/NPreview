# TODO

- Need to change the `u` variable to `my.u`
- Need to implement a custom function to break the columns of a table
  so that the vertical bar character is only treated as a column separator
  when it is proceeded and followed by a space at the same time, or as the last
  character of the line, or as the first character of the line.
- When 'math' block is detected to have labels and turned
  into an equation block for latex and html, it does not
  quite work when 'alignequalsign' is set.
- The replaceREF() function might not have worked for EPUB because of the
  ID might have been in different files.
