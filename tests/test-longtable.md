(*) Node.JS
(*) AngularJS

(*) Node.js is a cross-platform run-time environment for applications
  written in JavaScript language.
(*) AnglarJS is an open source web application development framework
  developed by Google.

(*) You need to install Node.js on the computer system.
(*) You just need to add AngularJS file just like any other JavaScript
  file to use it in applications.

(*) It is written in C, C++ and JavaScript languages. Node.js supports
  non-blocking input/output API and an event-driven architecture.
(*) AngularJS is written entirely in JavaScript. It also allows
  extending the HTML's syntax to describe the components of your
  application.

(*) Node.js is useful to build fast and scalable server-side networking
  applications.
(*) AngularJS framework is best suited for building single-page
  client-side web applications.

(*) Node.js has many different frameworks like Sails.js, Partial.js, and
  Express.js,.
(*) AngularJS is itself web application framework.

(*) Node.js is Ideal for developing small size projects.
(*) AngularJS is Ideal for creating highly active and interactive web
  apps.

(*) For Node.js, developers can use JavaScript on the client as well as
  the server. So they can focus on learning one language.
(*) For Angular JS developer needs a deep understanding of prototyping,
  scope, and various other JavaScript aspects.

(*) Node.js is quite useful for generating database queries because
  JavaScript is used to write database queries for databases like
  MongoDB, CouchDB. This reduces the developer's task as they don't
  need to remember the syntax differences while combining Node.js and
  NoSQL databases.
(*) For AngularJS almost all other frameworks implement MVC by asking
  splitting an app into MVC components. It is difficult task, but
  Angular makes it simple as it implements MVC by splitting the app
  into MVC components.

(*) Node.js will be an ideal option for the real-time collaborative
  drawing/editing-type apps, where the user can see the document being
  modify live by another user like Dropbox or Google Docs.
(*) Angular's declarative approach simplifies app development in a sort
  of WYSIWYG way. Instead of spending time on how the program flows
  and what loaded first the developers can define what they want, and
  Angular JS will take care of the dependencies.

(*) Node.js will be useful in situations when something faster and more
  scalable is needed.
(*) Angular is useful in creating real time applications like instant
  messaging or chat apps.
