  $a= Node.JS 
  $b= AngularJS 

  $a= 3fr
  $b= 5fr

  $a= Node.js is a cross-platform run-time environment for applications\
    written in JavaScript language. (✗)
  $b= AnglarJS is an open source web application development framework\
    developed by Google (谷歌) \(\sqrt{2}\) 

  $a= You need to install Node.js on the computer system.
  $b= You just need to add AngularJS file just like any other JavaScript\
    file to use it in applications. (簡単)

  $a= It is written in C, C++ and JavaScript languages. Node.js supports\
    non-blocking input/output API and an event-driven architecture.
  $b= AngularJS is written entirely in JavaScript. It also allows\
    extending the HTML's syntax to describe the components of your\
    application. 

  $a= Node.js is useful to build fast and scalable server-side networking\
    applications.
  $b= AngularJS framework is best suited for building single-page\
    client-side web applications.

  $a= Node.js has many different frameworks like Sails.js, Partial.js, and\
    Express.js,.
  $b= AngularJS is itself web application framework.

  $a= Node.js is Ideal for developing small size projects.
  $b= AngularJS is Ideal for creating highly active and interactive web\
    apps.

  $a= For Node.js, developers can use JavaScript on the client as well as\
    the server. So they can focus on learning one language.
  $b= For Angular JS developer needs a deep understanding of prototyping,\
    scope, and various other JavaScript aspects.

  $a= Node.js is quite useful for generating database queries because\
    JavaScript is used to write database queries for databases like\
    MongoDB, CouchDB. This reduces the developer's task as they don't\
    need to remember the syntax differences while combining Node.js and\
    NoSQL databases.
  $b= For AngularJS almost all other frameworks implement MVC by asking\
    splitting an app into MVC components. It is difficult task, but\
    Angular makes it simple as it implements MVC by splitting the app\
    into MVC components.

  $a= Node.js will be an ideal option for the real-time collaborative\
    drawing/editing-type apps, where the user can see the document being\
    modify live by another user like Dropbox or Google Docs.
  $b= Angular's declarative approach simplifies app development in a sort\
    of WYSIWYG way. Instead of spending time on how the program flows\
    and what loaded first the developers can define what they want, and\
    Angular JS will take care of the dependencies.

  $a= Node.js will be useful in situations when something faster and more\
    scalable is needed.
  $b= Angular is useful in creating real time applications like instant\
    messaging or chat apps.
