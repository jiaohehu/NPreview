Beta function







In mathematics, the _beta function_,
also called the _Euler integral of the first kind_,
is a special function defined by

``
\Beta(x,y) = \int_0^1t^{x-1}{(1-t)}^{y-1}\,\mathrm{d}t 
, \;
\text{for} \; \mathrm{Re}(x), \mathrm{Re}(y) > 0
``

This is: ``
\Beta(x,y) = \int_0^1t^{x-1}{(1-t)}^{y-1}\,\mathrm{d}t 
, \;
\text{for} \; \mathrm{Re}(x), \mathrm{Re}(y) > 0
``

The beta function was studied by Euler and Legendre and was given its
name by Jacques Binet; its symbol ``\Beta`` is a Greek alphabet
the similar Latin alphabet B. The symbol ``\Alpha`` is also a good one.
