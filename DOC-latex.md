# LATEX translation


# Required LATEX Packages For LuaLaTeX

Following are required LATEX packages that must be included:

    \usepackage{microtype}
      A typesetting enhancement that improves the interspacing
      of words.

    \usepackage{luatexja-fontspec}
    \usepackage{luatexja-ruby}
      For allowing CJK characters to show up in LuaLaTeX.

    \usepackage{geometry}
      For setting left margins, right margins, and top margins
      of the generated PDF page.

    \usepackage{graphicx}
      For \includegraphics command.

    \usepackage{subcaption}
      For \begin{subfigure} environment.

    \usepackage{caption}
      For \caption*{...}

    \usepackage{enumitem}
      Improvements version of the classic \begin{itemize},
      \begin{enumerate}, and \begin{description} environments.
      Needed because Nitrile makes extensive use of the options
      of these environments provided by this package.

    \usepackage{mathtools}
    \usepackage{amsfonts}
    \usepackage{amssymb}
    \usepackage{unicode-math}
    \usepackage{stmaryrd}
    \usepackage{wasysym}
    \usepackage{textcomp}
      AMS math and addition math symbols and text symbols such as
      \textrightarrow.  Currently not utilized but will be in the future.

    \usepackage{changepage}
      Used to change the orientation of the page for example from
      portrait to landscape. Good for typesetting a wide table on a
      page by itself. The \adjustwidth command this package provides
      is also used extensively
      by Nitrile.

    \usepackage[unicode]{hyperref}
      Defines \href, \url, and others. Also allows for generating
      of PDF bookmarks.

    \usepackage{anyfontsize}
      Defines \selectfont{} used in typesetting of a verb block.

    \usepackage{tikz}
      For \begin{pgfpicture} and \begin{tikzpicture}

    \usepackage{luamplib}
      For \begin{mplibcode}

    \usepackage[normalem]{ulem}
      For \underline.

    \usepackage{listings}
      For \begin{lstlisting} used for typesetting code block.

    \usepackage{ltablex}
      Needed to make 'tabular' environment happy. If not include there
      are some unexplained compilation errors.ßßß

    \usepackage{tabularx}
      For \begin{tabularx} 

    \usepackage{tabulary}
      For \begin{tabulary} 

    \usepackage{tabu}
      For \begin{longtabu} 

    \usepackage{booktabs}
      For \toprule, \midrule, and \bottomrule

    \usepackage{xcolor}
      Needed to use color such as \xcolor{...}

    \usepackage[export]{adjustbox}
      For \resizebox command that is used for typesetting verb block.

# Setting the relative font size

Font sizes can be set for the following contents:

  code: "fscode" 
  listing: "fslisting"
  tabular: "fstabular"

The first one is used the SAMP block when its style is not
set to 1 or 2. The second one is used for listing contents.
The third one is used for tabular entries, which includes all
contents of TABR, TABB, and LONG contents.  

These options must only be used to specify a "relative font size".
The only valid relative font sizes are the following:

     size            factor
     ----------------------------
     tiny            0.5
     scriptsize      0.7
     footnotesize    0.8
     small           0.9
     normalsize      1.0
     large           1.2
     Large           1.4
     LARGE           1.7
     huge            2.0
     Huge            2.3
  
For example:

  %!LATEX.fscode=footnotesize
  %!LATEX.fslisting=scriptsize
  %!LATEX.fstabular=small


# Creating a LATEX document

When running 'nil' and the document is not a master document,
then no chapter is to be created, and only sections are.
In particular, each HDGS/1 block will become a "section"
of the CONTEX document, and the HDGS/2 block is to become
a subsection. If there is a HDGS/0 block it will also be 
part of the generated TEX document, but it will not be 
a section. It is simply a paragraph with a bigger font (\tfd).

If the ALL.title is set, then a title page will also be generated,
with the title set to this, and ALL.author will be included
if it is also specified. If ALL.title is not set, then no title
page will be created.

For a master document that includes other child documents, each child
document is to become a chapter (if "h1" is used). If ALL.title
is set, then a title page will be created. The "h1", "h2" designation
is to express the "indent" level, for which "h1" will treate each HDGS/0
block of each child document as a chapter, HDGS/1 as section, 
HDGS/2 as subsection, and so on. The "h2" designation is to treat
the HDGS/0 of each child document as a section, HDGS/1 as a subsection,
HDGS/2 as a subsubsection, and so on. 

# Libertine Fonts

Use use libertine fonts, add the following two lines to the preamble.

  \usepackage{libertine}
  \usepackage{libertinust1math}
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

For LUALATEX output, only the first two lines are needed.
