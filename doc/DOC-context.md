CONTEXT translation


[ Unicode Math symbols. ]
CONTEXT has some support for math symbols in Unicode.
For example, it does not provide support for \coloneq
symbol but we can type a Unicode character U+2254 directly
inside the math formular and it will work.

    \( A â‰” B \)

Following is a partial list of common LATEX symbols that
cannot be found on the CONTEXT side that must be
typeset by a Unicode character.

- \coloneq 
- \ctdot
