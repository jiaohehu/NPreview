[x] change it so that triple-grave-accent fence would be a CODE block and triple-tilde is a VERB block.

[ ] for article, the title and author should be optional and only set when they are present.

[ ] add a way to specify PART

[ ] add .listing directive.

[ ] add a phantom section for LSTG block for LATEX

[-] add a package menu item to allow it to generate LATEX document without having to go through the preview context menu. (not to be done because the View class provides essential functions that must be shown in order for a lot of functions to work such as saveAs())

[ ] figure out how to insert customized LATEX code.
