The "float" block

Following blocks are considered "float":

  PICT, TABR, FRMD, DIAG, VERB, MATH

Being "float" means when translated to LATEX 
each of them will always be in a "flaot", 
as defined by the "float" package. 

For CONTEX each of them will be subject to the
\placefloat command. 

For HTML translation each of these blocks will
be placed inside a <figure>.
