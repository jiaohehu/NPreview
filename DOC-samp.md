# The SAMP block

This block is to typeset sample compute code, as well
other text that is best to be shown as verbatim,
with texts in this block are shown verbatim, 
even multiple blanks are preserved, including
line breaks.

A block will be considered a SAMP block if 
*all* the lines are indented by at least one space.
Multiple consecutive SAMP blocks are *glued" together
to for a single SAMP block, and all the line from each
block are merged, with a single empty line inserted
between each block.
